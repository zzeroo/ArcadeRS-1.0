<!--
1. By-hand & type-checking setting values w/ PhantomData
2. Macroizing part by part (Cut & paste part by part)
-->

A while ago, I wrote an article called [A Rust macro for the builder pattern](/rust/builder-macro),
in which I explored the possibility of removing most boilerplate from the
builder pattern using macros. It was a pretty cool experiment, although if
you've followed me for a bit, you might have notice that I'm a big
[type-systems fan](/rust/typechecked-matrix) and, honestly, there's simply not
enough `PhantomData` in that solution.

Let's fix that right now! This will be a two-part series. In the first one, we
will implement that pattern by hand and, in the second, we will work a way to
automate that process with macros. Because who doesn't like macros!

1. The basic idea
2. Type-level booleans
3.

## The basic idea

Our objective here is to create a `Builder` structure for which mandatory
arguments aren't [provided in the constructor](https://aturon.github.io/ownership/builders.html),
but are instead fed to the builder through methods, like any other field. "But
they are mandatory!", you might reply. "How can we verify that we provided every
argument"? To this question, I might answer: by using `PhantomData`.

Say we want to create a builder for the following structure:

```rust
struct Orc {
    name: String,
    max_health: i32,
    health: i32,
}
```

We would like `name` and `max_health` to be mandatory, while `health` is
optional and will be set to the same value as `max_health` if no alternative is
provided. Our builder would thus have the following form:

```rust
struct OrcBuilder {
    name: Option<String>,
    max_health: Option<i32>,
    health: Option<i32>,
}

OrcBuilder::new()
    .name("Bobby".to_owned())
    .max_health(100)
    .build();
```

Except that this isn't quite good enough. We're still missing some ghostly
allies:

```rust
struct OrcBuilder<NameSet: Bool, MaxHealthSet: Bool> {
    _dat: PhantomData<(MaxHealth, Health)>,    
    name: Option<String>,
    max_health: Option<i32>,
    health: Option<i32>,
}
```

That's much better! You will notice that we do not call `unwrap` when building
our structure. This is because we _know_ at compile-time that all of the
necessary values are provided. Of course, `health` might be larger than
`max_health` and any of the two may very well be negative, but those issues are
not our builder's _fault_ and they are case-specific, so we will pretend like
those do not exist for the sake of simplicity.

How do we check whether all fields are filled? We specify it in the definition
of the `build` method:

```rust
impl OrcBuilder<True, True> {
    fn build(self) -> Orc {
        // Unwrap all mandatory things and invoke `unwrap_or_else` on optional
        // arguments, because the compiler checks statically that it is safe to
        // do so.
    }
}
```

If a completed `OrcBuilder` is one for which all of its parameters are `True`,
then a new one must have all of its parameters set to `False`:

```rust
impl OrcBuilder<False, False> {
    fn new(self) -> OrcBuilder<False, False> {
        OrcBuilder {
            _dat: PhantomData,
            name: None,
            max_health: None,
            health: None,
        }
    }
}
```

What happens when you want to set an mandatory parameter? Some type parameter is
changed from `False` to `True`:

```rust
impl<MaxHealthSet: Bool> OrcBuilder<False, MaxHealthSet> {
    fn name(self, name: String) -> OrcBuilder<True, MaxHealthSet> {
        OrcBuilder {
            _dat: PhantomData,
            name: Some(name),
            ..self
        }
    }
}

impl<NameSet: Bool> OrcBuilder<NameSet, False> {
    fn max_health(self, max_health: i32) -> OrcBuilder<NameSet, True> {
        OrcBuilder {
            _dat: PhantomData,
            max_health: Some(max_health),
            ..self
        }
    }
}
```

What if we want to change an optional parameter? Well, then you have nothing to
change type-wise: just assign the new value to its field!

```rust
// Notice how we keep the same time parameters in both case.
impl<NameSet: Bool, MaxHealthSet: Bool> OrcBuilder<NameSet, MaxHealthSet> {
    fn health(self, health: String) -> OrcBuilder<NameSet, MaxHealthSet> {
        OrcBuilder {
            _dat: PhantomData,
            health: Some(health),
            ..self
        }
    }
}
```

Now, that's not _exactly_ how we're going to define our `OrcBuilder` (notably
because copying it over and over again is pretty inefficient), but it's close
enough for us to move to the next step.


## Type-level booleans

It's surprisingly easy to create type-level booleans in Rust. All you need to do
is create a `Bool` trait and implement it for some non-instanciable `True` and
`False`, which we will define using empty enums:

```rust
pub trait Bool {
}

pub enum True {
}

pub enum False {
}

impl Bool for True {
}

impl Bool for False {
}
```

Nice and easy!
