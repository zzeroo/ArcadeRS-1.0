I am a student at the [CÃ‰GEP de Sherbrooke](http://cegepsherbrooke.qc.ca/),
where I learn about electronics, that is, until I find something more
interesting to do. I'm mostly self-educated, and I study computer science,
physics and mathematics on my spare time. I sometimes write about those
subjects.

More recently, I've been focusing on the Rust programming language, and I've
been trying to teach myself some quantum mechanics and functions of several
variables.

If you have an enterprise in Sherbrooke and like what I do enough to hire me,
I'm now officially for sales! Full disclosure: I do not have any experience as a
developer in a team, although I have built a web application on my own
professionally using PHP for the backend and [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
on the client-side in the 0.5 days. I am interested in building native and
Web apps, but [_not_ websites](https://www.joomla.org/). Cheers!
